## Basic Principals

* Biweekly one on one meeting with direct reports. Biweekly setup reduces number of meetings 
and provides enough discussion points with engineers. 
* Setup meetings with clear agenda, publish any information like link or document ahead of the meeting
so that everyone get chance to review it. Publish notes after meeting. 
* Involve entire team in design and architectural discussion and brain storming.  
* Create small group of 2-3 engineers who are subject matter expert.
* Understand team's execution ability. Understand team's capacity.

## Managing Remote Teams
* Setup team slack channel. Be active on the channel. Discourage one-on-one separate communication related to work.
* Make sure remote team is setup for success. Provide tools and technology for better productivity.
* Over communicate. Important to reiterate goals and objective of team and current project. 
* Focus on outcome and productivity. 
* Weekly standup video meeting.
